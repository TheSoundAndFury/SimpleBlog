*******************
Release Information
*******************

This repo contains in-development code for future releases. I don't know how much I'll continue to work on it as all the core funtionality is working. 


*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
